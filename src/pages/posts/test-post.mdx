excerpt: "In this post I'll be going over an interesting problem I had to solve for while building out the redesign for Synapse Studios' marketing page. We needed a way to store the colors or the 'theme' for the site and use those colors anywhere, in any component so that they can be edited from one source of truth. If we decide to change the theme, those changes should reflect everywhere the colors are being used on the site."
